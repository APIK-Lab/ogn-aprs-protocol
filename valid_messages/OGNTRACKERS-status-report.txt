Explantion of the fields:
h00 = hardware version (not being filled yet)
v00 = software version (not being filled yet)
9sat/1 = GPS status: 9 satellites, FixQuality=1 (GPS)
164m = altitude by GPS
1002.6hPa = pressure
+20.2degC = temperature by baro, if not present then by CPU (but not very accurate then)
0% = humidity, no sensor yet...
3.34V = battery voltage, here battery divider not installed thus simply the 3.3V VCC, subject to innacuracies due to Vref of the CPU.
-110dBm = is reasonable noise level, but often this can be like -90 or higher.
1/min = number of packets received per minute thus it gives an idea of (radio) traffic intensity
